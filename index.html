        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Tim Berners-Lee is a software engineer who invented the Internet (or the World Wide Web) in 1989 while at CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory.

            He is director of the World Wide Web Consortium that he founded and a Professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Oxford.

            In 2001 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 2004 he was knighted.The Early Life of Tim Berners-Lee
            Timothy John Berners-Lee was born in London on June 8, 1955. His parents were Mary Lee Woods and Conway Berners-Lee; he had three siblings. The Berners-Lee couple worked with the very first ever commercial computer, the Ferranti Mark 1 so you could say that computers were his legacy.

            He attended Sheen Mount Primary school then spent four years at Emanuel School in south west London. As a child, he was a very keen train-spotter and learned all about electronics through playing with his model railway.

            After his school years, Berners-Lee enrolled at the University of Oxford at Queenâ€™s College for three years and received a first class degree in physics in 1976.</p>
